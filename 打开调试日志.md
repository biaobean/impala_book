### Understanding What is Logged at Different Logging Levels

As logging levels increase, the categories of information logged are cumulative. For example, GLOG\_v=2 records everything GLOG\_v=1 records, as well as additional information.

Increasing logging levels imposes performance overhead and increases log size. Cloudera recommends using GLOG\_v=1 for most cases: this level has minimal performance impact but still captures useful troubleshooting information.

Additional information logged at each level is as follows:

* GLOG\_v=1 - The default level. Logs information about each connection and query that is initiated to an
  impalad
  instance, including runtime profiles.
* GLOG\_v=2 - Everything from the previous level plus information for each RPC initiated. This level also records query execution progress information, including details on each file that is read.
* GLOG\_v=3 - Everything from the previous level plus logging of every row that is read. This level is only applicable for the most serious troubleshooting and tuning scenarios, because it can produce exceptionally large and detailed log files, potentially leading to its own set of performance and capacity problems.





了解在不同日志记录级别记录的内容

随着日志记录级别增加，记录的信息的类别是累积的。例如，GLOG\_v = 2记录所有GLOG\_v = 1记录以及其他信息。



增加日志记录级别会增加性能开销并增加日志大小。 Cloudera建议在大多数情况下使用GLOG\_v = 1：此级别对性能影响最小，但仍捕获有用的故障排除信息。



在每个级别记录的附加信息如下：



GLOG\_v = 1 - 默认级别。记录有关启动到impalad实例的每个连接和查询的信息，包括运行时配置文件。

GLOG\_v = 2 - 来自上一级的所有内容，加上每个RPC启动的信息。此级别还记录查询执行进度信息，包括每个读取的文件的详细信息。

GLOG\_v = 3 - 从上一级加上记录每一行的所有内容。此级别仅适用于最严重的故障排除和调优方案，因为它可以生成非常大且详细的日志文件，从而潜在地导致其自身的一组性能和容量问题。
