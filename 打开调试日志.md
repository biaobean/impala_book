### Understanding What is Logged at Different Logging Levels

As logging levels increase, the categories of information logged are cumulative. For example, GLOG\_v=2 records everything GLOG\_v=1 records, as well as additional information.

Increasing logging levels imposes performance overhead and increases log size. Cloudera recommends using GLOG\_v=1 for most cases: this level has minimal performance impact but still captures useful troubleshooting information.

Additional information logged at each level is as follows:

* GLOG\_v=1 - The default level. Logs information about each connection and query that is initiated to an
  impalad
  instance, including runtime profiles.
* GLOG\_v=2 - Everything from the previous level plus information for each RPC initiated. This level also records query execution progress information, including details on each file that is read.
* GLOG\_v=3 - Everything from the previous level plus logging of every row that is read. This level is only applicable for the most serious troubleshooting and tuning scenarios, because it can produce exceptionally large and detailed log files, potentially leading to its own set of performance and capacity problems.
